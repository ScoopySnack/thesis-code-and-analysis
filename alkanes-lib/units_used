Kow-> logP // octanol-water partition coefficient, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octanol-water_partition_coefficient
// logP is the logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient, which is a measure of how hydrophobic a compound is.
//If logP is positive, the compound is more hydrophobic and prefers to partition into octanol rather than water else
// it prefers to partition into water rather than octanol.
// logP is dimensionless, but it is often expressed in units of mL/g or mL/mol.
// the numbers are usually between -3 and 6, with most compounds falling between -1 and 4. When close to 0,
// the compound is equally hydrophilic and hydrophobic, meaning it has a balanced affinity for both water and octanol.

// dyn/cm is a unit of surface tension, which is the force per unit length acting on the surface of a liquid.
